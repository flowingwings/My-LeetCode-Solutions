# Some title

My solution is too slow. The time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

The leetcode solution is optimized to $O(n)$, because it traded speed with space. Its space complexity is influenced by the size of the character set $m$. So in some extreme cases (when the character set is very large), my solution would cost less space than the leetcode solution. But the character set of test data is limited to ASCII, so no doubt that the leetcode solution is better.
